## Adding devices

!> You can continue to [Adding groups](#adding-groups) when you have a **People Counter NB-IoT** or when your **supplier already added the devices** for you

?> More information is coming soon

## Adding groups

To see data in the [dashboard](https://app.im-motion.net/dashboard/) you need to create one or more locations (groups).

Groups can be managed on the [Group Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/manager/groups). This can be opened via the menu **Settings->Groups**.

To add a new location just click the **Create new location** button<img src="./assets/cloud/create-new-location-button.png" alt="Create new location" class="image-75"> on the [Group Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/manager/groups) and fill out the form.

## Link devices to groups

Once you have created a group you can link one or more devices to it.

Groups can be managed on the [Group Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/manager/groups). This can be opened via the menu **Settings->Groups**.

## Creating users

To login on the account/tenant we recommend to create a user account for each user who is going to use the platform.

Users can be managed on the [User Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/users/) via the menu **Settings->Users**.
<img src="./assets/cloud/users-list.png" alt="Users list" class="image-75 image-center">

To add a user simply click on the **Add user** button<img src="./assets/cloud/add-user-button.png" alt="Link device" class="image-75">.

Enter the username and password for the new user and select the role.
<img src="./assets/cloud/add-user.png" alt="Users list" class="image-75 image-center">

?>**Username**: please use the email address of this person as username

?>**Password**: be sure a strong password is made

?>**Role**: There are 3 roles available for users: User, Restricted user, Admin
<hr>

**User**

This user can see the data from all locations.<br>
This user does not have access to Settings.

**Restricted user**

A restricted user can only see data from a selected list of locations.<br>
When adding a restricted user one or more locations can be selected.<br>
This user does not have access to Settings.

**Admin**

This user does have all rights to see data and change Settings.

When adding the user the platform will ask for **your user credentials** for additional security.

Once the user is added please inform that person by sharing the username and password to allow them to [login](https://app.im-motion.net).

?>**Note**: You can always change the user settings by clicking on the user on the [User Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/users/).
