## Adding groups

To see data in the [dashboard](https://app.im-motion.net/dashboard/) you need to create one or more locations (groups).

Groups can be managed on the [Group Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/manager/groups). This can be opened via the menu via **Settings->Groups**.

To add a new location just click the **Create new location** button on the [Group Management page](https://app.im-motion.net/manager/groups) and fill out the form.
